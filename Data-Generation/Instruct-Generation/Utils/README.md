# Utils: Utility Scripts for Data Processing and Transformation

This repository contains a collection of utility scripts created and used throughout the course of my research and development work. These scripts perform various tasks related to data processing, such as:

- **Data Cleansing**
- **Data Transformation** into standardized JSON formats
- **Parsing** and **Converting** Data from one structure to another
- **Text Preprocessing** and other general-purpose operations
- **Server Pinging** for checking availability
- **Many other helper scripts**

The scripts are designed to be efficient and straightforward, focusing on practical tasks that streamline and automate various parts of my workflow.

## Important Notes

- The utility scripts have not been reviewed for specific domain-related content (e.g., German legal terminology or comments). They focus primarily on the functionality and efficiency of the tasks they perform.
- Due to their simplicity and directness, no detailed explanations are provided within the scripts themselves or in this documentation.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository or copy the individual scripts you need.
2. Run the scripts as standalone programs or integrate them into larger workflows, depending on your needs.
3. The utilities do not require extensive configuration; most work with default settings or command-line arguments.
